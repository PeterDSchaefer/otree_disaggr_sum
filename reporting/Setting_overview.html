<div>The participants in this experiment have different tasks. One half of the participants are owners of a company,
the other half managers. Each participant is randomly assigned as either an owner or a manager.
    The experiment extends over eight periods. Each period consists of four steps:</div><br>

<p>1. Managers are randomly matched with owners to manage a division of the owner’s company.</p>
<p>2. The manager learns how much revenue her/his division will earn.</p>
<p>3. The manager reports to the owner how much revenue her/his division will earn and contribute to the company’s revenue. </p>
<p>4. The owner reads the manager’s report and accepts her/his contribution to the company’s revenue.</p>

<div>Only the manager learns the revenue that her/his division will actually earn. Both the owner and the manager know the
probability distribution of the revenue (i.e., the maximum and minimum revenue, and how likely each level of
revenue is to occur). However, the owner never learns the actual revenue.</div><br>
