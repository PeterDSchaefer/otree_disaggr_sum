        <p>The division sells three products. The revenue of the division is the sum total of the revenues of the three products:</p>
        <p>Revenue of the division = Revenue of Product #1 + Revenue of Product #2 + Revenue of Product #3.</p>
        <p>The revenue of each of the three products can take any value from 50 to 150 ECU (50, 51, â€¦, 150 ECU). Each value is equally likely.
            The revenues of the three products are independent from each other and can thus differ.</p>
        <p>As a result, the revenue of the division can take any value from 150 to 450 ECU. The probability distribution of the revenue looks as shown below.</p>

    {% if player.id_in_group == 1 %}
        <p>This information is known to both you and the owner. However, you also learn the actual revenue, the owner does not.</p>
    {% else %}
        <p>This information is known to both you and the manager. However, the manager also learns the actual revenue, you do not.</p>
