<p>The owner receives the revenue. If the manager reports less than her/his actual revenue, the manager pockets the difference at the expense of the owner. Both the owner and the manager receive a fixed payoff:
</p>

<p>Owner’s payoff = Owner’s fixed payoff + Reported revenue;</p>
<p>Manager’s payoff = Manager’s fixed payoff + Actual revenue − Reported revenue.</p>

<p>The currency of this experiment is experimental currency units (ECU), where 25 ECU = €1. Compensation
will be based on one of the eight periods, which will be randomly selected at the end of the experiment. The
owner and the manager only learn their own but not each other’s compensation.</p>
