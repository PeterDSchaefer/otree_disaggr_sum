        <p>In each period, you are randomly matched with an owner to manage a division of the owner’s company.

        <p>You receive a fixed salary of 175 ECU. If you report less than your actual revenue, you pocket in addition
            the difference at the expense of the owner:</p>

which will be randomly selected at the end of the experiment. You will learn your own but not the owner’s
compensation, and the owner will learn her/his own but not your compensation.</p>
